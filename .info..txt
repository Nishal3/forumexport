Our organization has a forum that has been running for quite some time, and we've recently added some
logic to mark comments on forum posts as positive or negative.
With this new information, some people without database access would
like to be able to have the information exported so that they can view reports.
To facilitate this, we've decided to create a library for interacting with the
database and models that we can easily utilize in scripts to export information
in a digestable form for whomever asks us. Our library will only provide models
for the database tables; the end user will be required to know how to set up a SQLAlchemy engine and session.

The forum database has two tables that we'd like to interact with:

* The posts table, which contains forum posts.
* The comments table, which contains comments that are associated with posts.
To model these tables we'll need to know the schema for the tables. Here's how they were created:

create table posts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    author_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
create table comments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    post_id INTEGER REFERENCES posts(id),
    comment TEXT NOT NULL,
    sentiment VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    commenter_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
